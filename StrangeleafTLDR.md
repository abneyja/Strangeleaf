#### Dr. Stephen Strangeleaf's Backstory TLDR
#### Early Life and Medical Career
Dr. Stephen Strangeleaf, a human from Baldur's Gate, was a renowned physician and alchemist known for his exceptional surgical skills. His career was cut short when a carriage accident severely damaged his hands. Unable to find a cure, he journeyed to Ithil-Tor, a hidden sanctuary in the Spine of the World mountains, where he met the Archmage Supreme.
#### Arcane Apprenticeship
Under her tutelage, Strangeleaf learned the arcane arts, compensating for his injured hands with willpower and intellect. He became involved in a conflict with Malcavius, a rogue wizard attempting to summon Zarathor, a powerful entity from the Dark Dimension. During battles to protect magical sanctums, Strangeleaf acquired the Cloak of Levitation and later the Eye of Agamotto.
#### The Climactic Battle
The climactic battle took place at the Baldur's Gate Sanctum, where Strangeleaf fought alongside Kaelen Firehand against Malcavius and his Zealots. Using the Eye of Agamotto, Strangeleaf created a temporal loop to confront Zarathor repeatedly. Through clever manipulation, he trapped Zarathor in a temporal paradox, banishing him back to the Dark Dimension. This victory prevented many deaths, including Kaelen's, though the Cloak of Levitation was lost in the temporal rift.
#### Aftermath and New Purpose
Using the Eye's power, Strangeleaf defeated Zarathor and his followers. His actions earned him recognition as the chosen successor to the Archmage Supreme. Strangeleaf then allied with Kaelen Firehand, the Ironfist, to hunt down remaining threats.
#### Current Quest
Their journey led them to investigate the Codex of Shadows, a book that could summon Zarathor again. This quest brought them to Neverwinter and eventually to Phandalin, where they joined a group of adventurers heading to the Mines of Phandelver, seeking to prevent the Codex from falling into the wrong hands.
