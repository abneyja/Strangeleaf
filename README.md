### Dr. Stephen Strangeleaf Backstory

#### Early Life and Medical Career

Dr. Stephen Strangeleaf, a half-elf, was born and raised in the vibrant city of Baldur's Gate. His elven mother, a skilled herbalist, and his human father, a knowledgeable scholar, instilled in him a deep respect for both nature and learning. From a young age, Strangeleaf showed an exceptional aptitude for the healing arts. He pursued a career as a physician and alchemist, dedicating himself to the study of anatomy, physiology, and the medicinal properties of plants and minerals.

Strangeleaf’s practice required exceptional dexterity and precision. He performed delicate surgeries, stitched wounds with unparalleled skill, and concocted precise alchemical remedies. His steady hands were his greatest asset, allowing him to perform intricate procedures that saved countless lives. Nobles and commoners alike sought his expertise, and his practice thrived. His blend of traditional medicine and alchemical science made him one of the most respected doctors in Baldur's Gate.

#### The Accident

Despite his success, Strangeleaf's life took a tragic turn. One stormy night, while hurrying to attend to a critically ill patient, Strangeleaf's carriage was involved in a catastrophic accident. The crash left him with severe injuries to his hands, damaging the intricate nerves and muscles that he relied upon to perform his delicate medical procedures. The very hands that once performed life-saving surgeries with finesse now trembled uncontrollably.

#### Desperation and Search for Healing

Desperate to regain the use of his hands, Strangeleaf exhausted his considerable resources seeking out any form of healing. He consulted with clerics, druids, and alchemists, and traveled to distant lands in search of cures. Despite his efforts, none could restore his hands to their former dexterity. His once-promising career lay in ruins, and his frustration grew as each attempt at a cure failed.

In his darkest hour, Strangeleaf encountered a former patient, Darian, whom he had once tried to help but could not. Darian had suffered a severe spinal injury and had been paralyzed from the waist down. Despite Strangeleaf's best efforts, he had been unable to heal him. Now, to Strangeleaf's amazement, Darian walked with ease. Intrigued and desperate for answers, Strangeleaf pressed Darian for the secret to his recovery. Darian revealed that he had been healed through ancient and mystical means at a hidden compound called Ithil-Tor, a sanctuary located deep within the Spine of the World mountains.

#### Journey to Ithil-Tor

Determined to find a cure, Strangeleaf embarked on a perilous journey to Ithil-Tor. The path was fraught with dangers, but Strangeleaf's determination drove him forward. Upon reaching Ithil-Tor, he was taken in by a wizard named Kalendros, a disciple of the revered Archmage Supreme.

The Archmage Supreme, a wise and powerful wizard, revealed the true nature of magic to Strangeleaf: that it is not solely about control and precision, but also about understanding, humility, and the balance of the universe. She showed him the Astral Plane and other dimensions, such as the Mirror Dimension. Strangeleaf, despite his arrogance and desperation, begged her to teach him the ways of magic.

The Archmage Supreme saw potential in Strangeleaf, despite his flaws, and agreed to take him on as a student. Under her tutelage and with Kalendros's guidance, Strangeleaf began to study the arcane arts. He learned to channel his inner strength and tap into the deeper wellsprings of arcane energy, compensating for his damaged hands with sheer willpower and intellect.

#### Transformation into a Wizard

As Strangeleaf's training progressed, he became more attuned to the magical energies of the universe. His hands, though still scarred and imperfect, became a symbol of his transformation. He learned to cast spells through intricate gestures and incantations, focusing his mind to overcome the physical limitations of his injuries. His natural aptitude for learning and his relentless determination allowed him to master spells that many wizards took years to learn.

#### The Dark Threat

One fateful day, a rogue wizard named Malcavius and his followers stole pages from a forbidden ancient text. They sought to summon a powerful entity from the Dark Dimension named Zarathor, a being of immense power who promised eternal life but at the cost of the world's destruction. To ensure Zarathor's arrival, Malcavius and his followers began targeting the magical sanctums that protected the world from other dimensions, including those in Waterdeep, Neverwinter, and Baldur's Gate.

Malcavius and his Zealots first attacked the Neverwinter Sanctum, shattering its defenses with a devastating surge of dark magic. In the midst of the chaotic battle, Strangeleaf was engaged in a desperate duel with one of Malcavius's lieutenants. As the Sanctum's protective wards collapsed, an unstable rift between dimensions was torn open. A powerful blast of arcane energy from the lieutenant's spell collided with Strangeleaf's counterspell, creating a vortex that engulfed Strangeleaf. In an instant, he was hurled through the rift, tumbling through the void before being violently expelled into the Baldur's Gate Sanctum. Disoriented but determined, Strangeleaf found himself in the heart of a new battleground. There, Strangeleaf encountered the mystical Cloak of Levitation, a sentient artifact that chose him as its bearer. As Malcavius and the Zealots launched their assault on the Baldur's Gate Sanctum, Strangeleaf used his newfound powers and the Cloak of Levitation to hold them off.

During the battle, the intense magical energies unleashed by Zarathor's followers caused a temporal rift, and in the chaos, the Cloak of Levitation was lost in the swirling vortex. Despite this setback, Strangeleaf managed to hold the Zealots at bay until reinforcements arrived in the form of Kalendros and the Archmage Supreme. Together, they fought off the attackers, but the damage had been done.

#### Ironfist's Intervention

Amidst the battle, Kaelen Firehand, the Ironfist, appeared. Drawn by the disturbance and recognizing the threat Malcavius posed, Kaelen intervened. His mission to protect the world from mystical threats aligned with Strangeleaf’s cause. Using his chi-powered strikes, Kaelen helped Strangeleaf fend off the Zealots and protect the sanctum.

However, the battle had taken a tragic turn, resulting in the deaths of many wizards, including his ally Kaelen Firehand.

#### Desperate Measures and the Temporal Loop

Desperate to save his fallen comrades and alter the outcome, Strangeleaf used the Eye of Agamotto to create a temporal loop, giving himself another chance to confront Malcavius and his followers. Strangeleaf faced Zarathor repeatedly, using each cycle to gather more information and outwit the entity. He cleverly manipulated Zarathor’s own power against him, each attempt bringing him closer to understanding the entity's weaknesses.

Finally, through precise manipulation of the Eye's power, Strangeleaf managed to trap Zarathor in a temporal paradox, severing the entity's connection to the mortal plane and banishing him back to the Dark Dimension. With Zarathor defeated, the time loop ended, and Strangeleaf found himself back in the present. The followers of Zarathor were scattered and demoralized, but the Cloak of Levitation remained lost in the temporal rift.

Despite this loss, Strangeleaf had secured a decisive victory, and his actions had saved his comrades and the magical sanctums from further harm. This triumph marked a significant milestone in his journey, establishing him as a powerful and resourceful wizard.

#### The Eye of Agamotto and New Purpose

In recognition of his bravery and ingenuity during the battle, the Archmage Supreme bestowed upon Strangeleaf the Eye of Agamotto, a powerful artifact that grants its bearer insight and control over time and space. This act of selflessness and cunning marked Strangeleaf as the chosen successor to the Archmage Supreme, setting him on a path to become the next protector of the arcane realms. With the Eye of Agamotto, Strangeleaf gained unparalleled knowledge and power. However, the Archmage Supreme also imparted a grave warning: great power comes with great responsibility. To become the next Archmage Supreme, Strangeleaf must prove himself by mastering the arcane arts and protecting the balance of the mystical world.

Driven by a sense of duty and the desire to atone for his past mistakes, Strangeleaf embarked on a quest to achieve the title of Archmage Supreme. His journey would take him to the farthest reaches of Faerûn, seeking out ancient tomes, lost artifacts, and powerful mentors. Along the way, he vowed to protect the world from mystical threats and to make amends for his past arrogance.

#### Intertwined Destinies

It was during this journey that fate led him to cross paths with Kaelen Firehand, the Ironfist. Together, their intertwined destinies would lead them to the Mines of Phandelver, where their combined strengths would be tested in ways they had never imagined. Strangeleaf's quest for mastery and Kaelen's mission to eradicate the remnants of Zarathor's followers would forge a powerful alliance, bound by their shared purpose and mutual respect. As bodyguards at the beginning of the Lost Mines of Phandelver, they search for the scattered followers of Zarathor, ensuring that the dark threat is forever extinguished.
